`reBird` is a package to interface with the eBird webservices.

eBird is a real-time, online bird checklist program. For more information, visit their website: http://www.ebird.org

The API for the eBird webservices can be accessed here: https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird+API+1.1

## Install

You can install the stable version from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rebird")
```

Or the development version from Github

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rebird")
```


# Direct use of `rebird`

Load the package

```{r}
library("rebird")
```

## Sightings at location determined by latitude/longitude

Search for bird occurrences by latitude and longitude point

```{r ebirdgeo1}
ebirdgeo(species = 'spinus tristis', lat = 42, lng = -76)
```

## Recent observations at a region

Search for bird occurrences by region and species name

```{r ebirdregion1}
ebirdregion(region = 'US', species = 'Setophaga caerulescens')
```


## Recent observations at hotspots

Search for bird occurrences by region

```{r ebirdhotspot}
ebirdhotspot(locID = c('L99381','L99382'))
```


## Frequency of observations at hotspots or regions

Obtain historical frequencies of bird occurrences by hotspot or region

```{r ebirdfreq}
ebirdfreq(loctype = 'hotspots', loc = 'L196159')
```

# `rebird` and other packages

## How to use `rebird`

This package is part of a richer suite called [spocc - Species Occurrence Data](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc), along with several other packages, that provide access to occurrence records from multiple databases. We recommend using `spocc` as the primary R interface to `rebird` unless your needs are limited to this single source.

## `auk` vs. `rebird`

Those interested in eBird data may also want to consider [`auk`](https://github.com/CornellLabofOrnithology/auk), an R package that helps extracting and processing the whole eBird dataset. The functions in `rebird` are faster but mostly limited to accessing recent (i.e. within the last 30 days) observations, although `ebirdfreq()` does provide historical frequency of observation data. In contrast, `auk` gives access to the full set of ~ 500 million eBird observations. For most ecological applications, users will require `auk`; however, for some use cases, e.g. building tools for birders, `rebird` provides a quicker and easier way to access data. `rebird` and `auk` are both part of the rOpenSci project.
